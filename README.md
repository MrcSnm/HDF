# HipDDF

Hipreme D Data Format. Data format based on the D programming language.

This repository is not update directly. It is an adaptation from the HipDDF inside the [Hipreme Engine](https://github.com/MrcSnm/HipremeEngine). As the Hipreme Engine uses its own standard lib. So, there's
little adaptation to the original version.
